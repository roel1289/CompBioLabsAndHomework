## Introduction
As more and more land humans are taking over habitat for many species, it is becoming more and more important to learn about these species. 

## Biological Question
When researching rivers and other aquatic habitats, studying the fish that live
in those habitats is very common, and there are a couple ways to catch these fish. 
Some of the main methods to catch fish for research are a dipnet, hoop, and a seine.
For my data analysis, I am asking the ***question*** how do the average length of fish 
and variability compare between the three fishing methods: a dipnet, hoop, and a seine?

## Methods
### The data I will be looking at:
The data set I will be looking into is one by Kathrine Behn and Colden Baxter regarding the Little Colorado River in Arizona. 
This dataset is called [ _The trophic ecology of a desert river fish assemblage: influence
of season and hydrologica variability_ ](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.4q50bp6)
. 
### The Authors Original Intent
The main intent of the original authors was to determine how factors such as the influence of seasons and
hydrological variability influence the foodweb of a river. 
## Results and Conclusion
