# How different fishing methods reflect the size of fish
By Ross Ellwood
## Biological Question
When researching rivers and other aquatic habitats, studying the fish that live
in those habitats is very common, and there are a couple ways to catch these fish. 
Some of the main methods to catch fish for research are a dipnet, hoop, and a seine.
For my data analysis, I am asking the ***question*** how do the average length of fish 
and variability compare between the three fishing methods: a dipnet, hoop, and a seine?

## Methods
### The data I will be looking at:
The data set I will be looking into is one by Kathrine Behn and Colden Baxter. 
It is called [ _The trophic ecology of a desert river fish assemblage: influence
of season and hydrologica variability_ ](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.4q50bp6)
. The main goal of the original study is determine how factors such as the 
influence of seasons and hydrological variability affect the foodweb of a river.
