###Problem 1: Writing a function that calculates the area of a triangle ((0.5 * base) * Height)
myTriangleAreaFunc <- function(base,height){  #the function variables are base and height
  myTriAreaEq <- (0.5 * base * height)          #MyTriArea is the equation to calculate triangle area
  return(myTriAreaEq)
}
myTriangleAreaFunc(10, 9)

###Problem 2:
