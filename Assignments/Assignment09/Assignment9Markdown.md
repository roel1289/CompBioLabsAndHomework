## Introduction
With a changing climate, the habitat for more and more species is drastically changing. One of the areas that is hit the hardest
are rivers and streams, and one of the main residents of these areas are fish. The research of various fish is very important to keep them 
healthy. In order to research fish there are various methods. One method is to identify and count fish while they are in the water, while another
method is to catch them and pull them out of the water. For my analysis, I will be looking into how the various research methods of catching fish compare. 
This leads me into my research question. 

## Biological Question
When researching rivers and other aquatic habitats, studying the fish that live
in those habitats is very common, and there are a couple ways to catch these fish. 
Some of the main methods to catch fish for research are a dipnet, hoop, and a seine.
For my data analysis, I am asking the ***question*** how do the average length of fish 
and variability compare between the three fishing methods: a dipnet, hoop, and a seine?

## Methods
### The data I will be looking at:
The data set I will be looking into is one by Kathrine Behn and Colden Baxter regarding the Little Colorado River in Arizona. 
This dataset is called [ _The trophic ecology of a desert river fish assemblage: influence
of season and hydrologica variability_ ](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.4q50bp6)
. 
### The Authors Original Intent
The main intent of the original authors was to determine how factors such as the influence of seasons and
hydrological variability influence the foodweb of a river. In order to produce this data, the authors focused on four native
species of fish: _blue head sucker, flannelmouth sucker, speckled dace_, and the _endangered humpback chub_. The authors looked
into the diets of these fish across different seasons to see how the diets varied throughout change. 
### The Data
After taking many samples and measurements, the authors combined their information into a series of five datasets. For my project,
I only looked at one of the datasets; it has 10 columns: date, gear, species, total length of fish, fork length of fish, 
estimate weight (grams) of fish, weight source, whether or not the fish was sampled for diet, fish ID, and any notes. Within the whole 
dataset, there are 2736 rows or observations.
