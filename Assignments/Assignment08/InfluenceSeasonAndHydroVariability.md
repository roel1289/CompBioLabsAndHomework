# Data for the *The trophic ecology of a desert ricer fish assemblage: influence of season and hydrologic variability*
[Link for data](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.4q50bp6)

### Goals of the original study:
With the rise of humans, more and more animal habitats are being altered; 
it is especially changing in river habitats. One study by Kathrine Behn and 
Colden Baxter takes a look into this phenomena. The main goal of this study is to determine how factors such as the influence of
seasons and hydrological variability influence the foodweb of a river. 
	
	
### Methods authors used to produce the data: 
In order to do this, the authors focused on one area: the Little Colorado River in 
Arizona, and focused on four native species: _blue head sucker_, _flannelmouth sucker_, _speckled dace_, and _endangered humpback chub_.
During the spring and summer seasons, they took a look into the fishes diets. Using
this information, they made food webs and compared the different diets across the different seasons.

### Type of data:
1. Format:
There are five different data sets. In the first data set, there are 10 columns: date, gear, species, total length of fish, fork length
of fish, estimate weight (grams) of fish, weight source, whether or not the fish was
sampled for diet, fish ID, and any notes. There are 2736 rows or observations in the dataset. The fish that are labeled with an ID are then put into the latter data
sets. These data sets look into what exactly the fish were eating. The later datasets get more specific looking into 
the fish that are identified. The dataset I will be focusing has 12 different columns and 1823 observations. 
2. Size: 
This data has 2736 observations of 10 variables.
3. Inconsistencies or problems:
Within the data, there are a couple problems. First, there are no dates given, they are all
filled with ########. Second, in the weight estimate, weight source, fish ID, and notes column, there are 
very many instances where there is missing data. 
4. Data representation about biology:
This data takes a look at 4 different fish species, their lengths, and their diets.

## My Analysis
In the study, there are three methods for catching the fish to measure. These methods are a dipnet, hoop, and a seine. At a 
quick glance, it may seem that that each of these methods should catch the same types of fish, but is it possible that there are 
certain biases as to whether some methods may tend to catch different fish? This leads me to the main ***question*** of my analysis: 
how to the average length of fish compare between the three fising methods?
